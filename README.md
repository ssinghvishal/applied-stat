# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics

## Overview

This project involves analyzing customer purchase behavior using descriptive statistics, probability distributions, and visualizations to uncover actionable insights and segment customers based on their purchasing habits and demographics. The analysis helps businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## Objectives

Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation) for key variables.

Identify potential outliers in the dataset and handle them appropriately.

Analyze probability distributions of relevant variables and calculate probabilities and expected values.

Explore relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits through visualizations.

Segment customers based on their behaviors and characteristics.

## Dataset Description

1. The dataset includes the following key variables:

2. Income: Customer's income

3. Recency: Number of days since last purchase

4. MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts: Amount spent on specific product categories

5. NumDealsPurchases: Number of purchases using deals

6. NumWebPurchases: Number of purchases through the web

7. NumWebVisitsMonth: Number of visits to the website in the last month

8. Education: Education level of the customer

9. Marital_Status: Marital status of the customer
Analysis Steps

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Measures of Central Tendency: Calculate mean, median, and mode for key variables to understand their central tendencies.

Measures of Dispersion: Compute variance and standard deviation to assess variability.

Outlier Detection: Use boxplots to identify and handle outliers for variables such as Income and TotalSpend.

### 2. Probability Distributions

Determine suitable probability distributions (e.g., Normal, Binomial) for variables like Income and Total Purchases.

Calculate probabilities, such as the likelihood of Income exceeding a certain threshold.

Derive expected values based on identified distributions.

### 3. Insights and Segmentation

Explore relationships between customer characteristics (e.g., Income, Education, Marital_Status) and spending habits using scatterplots and boxplots.

Calculate and visualize a correlation matrix to identify strong and weak relationships between variables.

Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques to identify distinct groups.

### 4. Visualizations

Scatterplots: Display relationships (e.g., Income vs. TotalSpend).

Heatmap: Visualize correlations between key variables.

Boxplots: Highlight spending habits across education levels and marital statuses.

### 5. Recommendations

Income-based tiers: Design tiered marketing strategies for high-income customers.

Behavior-based promotions: Create loyalty programs for frequent shoppers.

Improved engagement: Develop targeted campaigns to increase web visits and purchases.

## Deliverables

Descriptive Statistics Report: Summary of key measures (mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation).

Outlier Analysis: Identification and handling of potential outliers.

Probability Analysis: Probabilities and expected values for identified distributions.

Visualizations: Plots showcasing relationships, trends, and segment characteristics.

Actionable Recommendations: Insights to enhance customer engagement and business performance.

## Tools Used

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

Statistical Techniques: Descriptive statistics, probability distributions

Visualization Tools: Heatmaps, scatterplots, boxplots

Clustering Algorithm: K-Means for segmentation

## Results and Insights

Strong correlations were observed between Income and spending habits.

Customers with higher education levels and stable marital statuses showed increased spending.

Segmentation identified high-value customer groups for targeted marketing efforts.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for improving customer engagement strategies. By understanding customer purchase behavior and segmenting them effectively, businesses can tailor their offerings and enhance overall performance.
